# 🛠️ SYNTAX GUIDE

## 1. The Structure
Syn'Tek sentences are structured like **API Transactions**.
Always follow this pattern:

`[COMMAND] :: [OBJECT] >> [RESULT/DESTINATION]`

* **Wrong:** "I want to eat a pizza." (Too literary)
* **Right:** `FETCH :: RATION [PIZZA] >> DEST: HQ` (Clear instruction)

## 2. The Operators

### `::` (Definition)
Pronounced: **Zed**
* Links a Command to its Object.
* Links a Subject to its State.
    * *Ex:* `STATUS :: SELF` (My status is...)

### `>>` (Output)
Pronounced: **Ash**
* Indicates movement, direction, or recipient.
* Replaces: "to", "for", "towards", "give to".
    * *Ex:* `>> TARGET: YOU` (For you)

### `//` (Parameters)
Pronounced: **Vel**
* Adds details. Can be replaced by brackets `[]` in written text.
* *Ex:* `VEHICLE // FAST` or `VEHICLE [SPEED: FAST]`

## 3. Phonetics & Accent
* **Hard Consonants:** Emphasize K, T, P, Ch.
* **Robotic Rhythm:** Do not link words. Speak with small pauses between tokens.
* **No Politeness:** Do not say "Please" or "Could you". Use `REQ` or `CMD`.

* *Phrase:* `FETCH :: RATION`
* *Sound:* "FETCH - (pause) - ZED - (pause) - RA-SHON"
